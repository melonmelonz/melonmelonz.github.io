# Quiz.exe

> A retro general knowledge quiz styled as a Windows 95 desktop application.

> 🍦 Static CSS, HTML & JS.

Made for the Next Step application. Tools used: mix of nvim, avante, claude/mistral modles, ccode and sometimes VSCodium for specific plugins. I can explain every line and could have gotten this done 10x as fast had I fully leveraged my AI setup but I know you want to see use showcase what we can do ourselves.

I was already tuning my KDE theme to look similar so I had the palette ready to go.

As of writing my friends' highest score has been 6/10; you all no doubt can do better.

I appreciate the opportunity!
